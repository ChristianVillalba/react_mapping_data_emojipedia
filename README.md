# React: Mapping Data Practice - emojipedia
Created with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)      
Notes from: React module    
[The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)  
Instructor: Dr. Angela Yu      

## Description
This app renders a heading: "emojipedia"        
and 4 entries:
* Tense Biceps
* Person With Folded Hands
* Rolling On The Floor, Laughing
* Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes

Each entry includes:
* Emoji
* Name
* Definition

These entries were created using the map function.

## What I have learned with this project:    
* Convert hard coded Components into Functions that can be used inside the Map Function.
* Using unique key props neccessary for the map function.
* How to apply styles to the new created components.
* Import modules (from emojipedia.js) to create an Entry Componets for each item in our emojipedia.js file.
  * If we create a new item in emojipedia.js, a new Entry will be rendered in our page.
